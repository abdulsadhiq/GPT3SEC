       " 'JURISDICTION AND VENUE ': 'SUMMARY \\n1. This action arises from Defendant Jus tin Sun’s (“Sun”) or chestration of the \\nunregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities. \\n2. Working through several companies that  he owns and controls—including \\nDefendants Tron Foundation Limited (“Tron Foundation”), BitTorrent Foundation Ltd. \\n(“BitTorrent Foundation”), and Rainberry, Inc. (“ Rainberry,” and collectively with Sun, the Tron \\nFoundation, and the BitTorrent Foundation, the “S un Defendants”)—Sun e ngineered the offer \\nand sale of two crypto asset securities called “TRX” and “B TT.”  Starting around August 2017, \\nand continuing thereafter, the Sun Defendants engage d in a scheme to distribute billions of TRX \\nand BTT to the public while also creating ac tive secondary markets on which TRX and BTT \\ncould be traded.   Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 1 of 50 23. The Sun Defendants offered and sold TRX and BTT as securities and were thus \\nrequired to register those offers and sales with the SEC unless an  exemption from registration was \\navailable.  But they never did so.  Despite engagi ng in widespread public offers and sales of TRX \\nand BTT, and even thou gh no exemption from registration wa s available, neith er Sun nor his \\nentities ever filed a registration statemen t with the SEC. \\n4. Sun also directed the manipul ative wash trading of TRX to create the artificial \\nappearance of legitimate investor interest and k eep TRX’s price afloat.  Su n accomplished this wash \\ntrading through: the Tron Foundati on, whose employees conducted the trades at Sun’s direction; the \\nBitTorrent Foundation, which, together with th e Tron Foundation, owned and controlled nominee \\naccounts used in the trading; an d Rainberry, whose empl oyees transferred funds  to facilitate the \\ntrading and opened at l east one nominee account used in the trading.  Sun’s wa sh trading team, \\nworking under his direction, engaged in hundred s of thousands of TRX wash trades between \\naccounts that Sun ultimately contro lled.  None of those trades i nvolved any change in beneficial \\nownership or had any legitimate economic purpose. \\n5. To drive public interest in  TRX and BTT, the Sun Defe ndants created a publicity \\ncampaign that involved paying celebrities, incl uding Defendants Austin  Mahone (“Mahone”) and \\nDeAndre Cortez Way (“Way”), amo ng others, to promote or tout TRX and BTT on their social \\nmedia accounts, which had millions of followers.  Although the celebrities were paid to promote \\nTRX and BTT, their touts on social media did not disclose that they had been paid or the amounts of \\ntheir payments.  Thus, the public  was misled into believing that  these celebrities had unbiased \\ninterest in TRX and BTT, and were not merely paid spokespersons.   \\n6. Additionally, Sun materially misrepresented the truth about the touting campaign \\nto deceive investors.  In Februa ry 2021, Sun stated falsely on soci al media, “If any celebrities are Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 2 of 50 3paid to promote TRON, we require them to di sclose.”  In fact, Sun himself arranged the \\npayments to celebrities and knew those payments were not disclosed.   \\n7. By their conduct alleged he rein, the Sun Defendants viol ated registration and anti-\\nfraud provisions of the Se curities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), specifically Sections 5(a) and \\n(c), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a)  and (c), and S ections 17(a)(1) and (3 ) of the Securities Ac t, 15 U.S.C. §§ \\n77q(a)(1) and (3).  They  also violated anti-mani pulation and anti-fraud provi sions of the Securities \\nand Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”),  specifically Sections 9(a )(1) and (2), 15 U.S.C. \\n§§ 78i(a)(1) and (2), and Section 10(b) of the Exch ange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 \\nthereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.  Additionally, they  aided and abetted violations of the anti-\\ntouting provision, Section 17(b) of the S ecurities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(b), by multiple \\ncelebrities, including Mahone and Way. \\n8. By their conduct alleged herein, Mah one and Way violated the anti-touting \\nprovision, Section 17(b) of the Secu rities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(b). \\n9. Unless restrained and enjoin ed, Defendants will  continue to violate the federal \\nsecurities laws.',\n",

At \\nall relevant times, Sun acted through, on behalf of, and for th e benefit of the Tron Foundation, \\nthe BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry.  \\n13.

The Tron Foundation is one of several alter-\\nego entities organized by Sun through which he conducted the TRX and BTT offerings and \\nmanaged the development and marketing of the Tron ecosystem.  From 2017 to the present, Sun \\nhas owned and controlled the Tron Foundation.    \\n14. Defendant BitTorrent Foundation Ltd.

The \\nBitTorrent Foundation is one of  several alter-ego entities orga nized by Sun, including the Tron \\nFoundation, through which he conducted the B TT offerings and managed, together with \\nRainberry, Inc., the development and marketing of  the BitTorrent protocol.

       " 'BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS ': 'BACKGROUND ON SECU RITIES OFFERINGS \\n18. Congress enacted the Securities Act to regulate the offer a nd sale of securities.  In \\ncontrast to commercial principles of caveat emptor  (or buyer beware), Congress in the Securities \\nAct enacted a regime of full and fair disclosure , requiring those who offer and sell securities to \\nthe investing public to provide sufficient, accu rate information to allow investors to make \\ninformed decisions before they invest. \\n19. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securitie s Act generally require an issuer of \\nsecurities to register an offe ring of securities through an effec tive registration statement before \\nthe securities are offered and sold to the public.  See 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and (c).  Registration \\nstatements for a securities offe ring provide public investors with material information about the \\nissuer and the securities to be offered and sold. \\n20. Section 2(a)(1) of the Securi ties Act defines “security” to include a wide range of \\ninvestment vehicles, including an “investment contra ct.”  15 U.S.C. § 77b(a )(1).  An investment \\ncontract, for purposes of the Securities Act, in cludes any “contract, tr ansaction or scheme Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 5 of 50 6whereby a person invests his money in a common en terprise and is led to expect profits” from \\nthe efforts of others.  SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. , 328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946).  This broad \\ndefinition is “flexible” and “cap able of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes \\ndevised by those who seek the use of the mone y of others on the promise of profits.”  Id. at 299.  \\nCourts have found that many types of investme nts, including crypto assets, may constitute \\ninvestment contracts and thus securities.  See, e.g. , SEC v. Kik Interactive Inc. , 492 F. Supp. 3d \\n169, 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (holding th at certain crypto assets were  sold as securities in \\nunregistered transactions).  \\n21. In analyzing whether something is a s ecurity, “form should be disregarded for \\nsubstance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight , 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on \\neconomic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.”  United \\nHousing Found., Inc. v. Forman , 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975).',\n",
       " 'FACTS ': 'BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS \\n22. The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/ or transferred using \\ndistributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as \\n“cryptocurrencies,” “digital assets,” “virtual curre ncies,” “digital coins,” and “digital tokens.” \\n23. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a \\nnetwork of computers that records all transact ions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally \\nrecorded data packages.  The system relies on cryptographic techniques fo r secure recording of \\ntransactions. \\n24. Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” transactions, \\nwhich, among other things, aims to  achieve agreement on a data value or on the state of the \\nledger.  Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 6 of 50 7crypto assets; they may also be also be purchased or sold from the platform in exchange for fiat \\ncurrency (legal tender issued by a country). \\n25. A blockchain “protocol” is a code, so ftware, or algorithm that governs how a \\nblockchain, or a feature of a blockchain, operates, including, among other things, the validation \\nmechanism used for the particular blockchain. \\n26. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued the Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section \\n21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO , advising “those who would use . . . \\ndistributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising[] to take  appropriate steps to \\nensure compliance with the U.S. federal securiti es laws,” and finding that the offering of crypto \\nassets at issue in that report involved investment contracts and thus securities.',\n",
       " '                                                 ': '2  “Staking” concerns the “proof of stake” validation protocols that certain blockchains utilize.  These \\nprotocols offer rewards to those who “validate”—or confirm—transactions on the blockchain.  To become a \\nvalidator and obtain such rewards, holders of crypto asse ts must first “stake”—or commit—crypto assets (typically, \\nthe “native” crypto asset on a particular  blockchain).  Validators are selected based on the size of their stake, among \\nother factors, creating an incentive to stake, or commit, greater quantities of crypto assets.  The protocols incentivize \\nvalidators to add legitimate transactions to the blockchain because validators are rewarded  if they do and could be \\npenalized if they do not, including by having the staked crypto assets “slashed” (or destroyed). \\n3  Telegram is a cross-platform messaging application commonly used by crypto asset issuers and promoters \\nto disseminate information about crypto asset offers and sales to interested parties and potential investors. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 20 of 50 21Capitalization!”  Similarly, in February 2021, @B itTorrent tweeted that “$BTT Price Hits New \\nHigh.  $BTT grew + 151% in 24 hours, +232% in 7 days.  #BTT to the [sic] Mars,” with two \\nrocket emojis.   \\n84. The @BitTorrent Twitter account also promoted BTT’s “ROI” or “return on \\ninvestment” on social media, for example by re tweeting a post on July 2, 2019 comparing BTT’s \\n“current ROI” of “11.16x” to lower ROIs of othe r tokens also offered through IEOs.  Later, on \\nJuly 19, 2021, Rainberry promoted BTT’s second ary market performance, highlighting that \\n“[a]ccording to CryptoRank Platform, #BitTorrent  is Top 3 gainer with  751% profits in 2021.” \\n85. In addition to promoting the BTT secondary market, the Sun Defendants also \\nworked to make BTT available for trading on nume rous crypto asset trading platforms.  “Listing \\napplications” submitted to multiple crypto asset trading platforms, including the Trading Platform, listed the BitTorrent F oundation as the applicant.   \\n86. The Sun Defendants’ efforts to promote and grow a robust secondary market for \\ntrading in BTT were successful.  According to  a December 20, 2019 tweet by @BitTorrent, as of \\nthat date at least 39 crypto a sset trading platforms had made available BTT for trading. \\n87. The availability of BTT on numerous trad ing platforms allowed investors in the \\nU.S. to purchase and sell BTT, which they di d.  On January 5, 2019, Sun posted a livestream to \\nYouTube in which he encouraged U. S. investors to “use the Bitcoi n . . . or any cryptocurrency to \\nbuy the BTT in the future,” despite apparent restri ctions on U.S. investors’ participation in the \\nBTT IEO.  On May 11, 2021, the @BitTorrent Tw itter account posted a link to a video by “Mike \\nTha Investor” with information “for those who doesn’t [sic] know how to buy #BTT in the U.S.” \\nIV. The Sun Defendants Engaged in Unregistered BTT Offers and Sales \\n88. BTT was offered and sold as a security, sp ecifically as an i nvestment contract.  \\nAll BTT purchasers, including those who tendere d value for BTT other than cash or crypto Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 21 of 50 22assets, invested in a common enterprise alongside the Sun Defendants, who at all times retained \\nsignificant BTT holdings.  Because the value of BTT rose or fell together for all holders, all BTT \\nholders profited or suffered losses in amounts proportionate to their BTT holdings.  As such, \\ntheir fortunes—including the realization of future profits—were inextricably tied to those of the Sun Defendants and each other’s.   \\n89. BTT purchasers’ and holders’ prospective profits also depended largely on the \\nefforts of the Sun Defendants to develop the BitT orrent protocol, grow public interest in BTT \\nand TRX, take steps to make BTT available fo r trading on crypto asset trading platforms, and \\npromote BTT to potential investors so as to increase its secondary market price for all holders.  \\nAnd, given the Sun Defendants’ promotional stat ements, BTT purchasers and holders reasonably \\nexpected that the value of their investment would largely rise or fall on th ese efforts to increase \\nBTT’s valueFrom at least February 2019 thr ough October 2021, the Sun Defendants offered and \\nsold BTT in the 9 types of unregistered s ecurities transactions described below. \\n90. No registration statement was ever filed with  the SEC or in effect with respect to, \\nand no exemption from registration was available fo r, any of these offers and sales of BTT.  \\nThus, the offers and sales of BTT set forth be low violated the regist ration provisions of the \\nfederal securities laws. \\nA. Offers and Sales of BTT in Monthly “Airdrops” \\n91. From on or about February 11, 2019, through June 13, 2020, the Sun Defendants \\noffered and sold BTT through monthly so-called “airdrops” to TRX holders.  \\n92. In the crypto asset space, an airdrop typical ly refers to the distribution of crypto \\nassets to certain recipients, pur portedly without requiring them to  pay cash consideration for the \\nasset.  With respect to BTT, however, the recipien ts had to purchase and hold TRX to be eligible Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 22 of 50 23for airdrops of BTT.  Indeed, anyone who purchased and held TR X in a Tron digital wallet or on \\na participating crypto asset trading platform recei ved BTT regardless of their geographic location \\nor country of citizenship.  \\n93. On January 4, 2019, before the BTT IE O, Sun and the Tron Foundation both \\n“teased” the BTT monthly airdrop program to th eir followers, tweeting, “Keep decentralizing the \\nweb, tokenizing the world’s largest decentralized file sharing protocol.  Wanna know more about \\n#BTT @BitTorrent, #BinanceLaunchpad, #niTR OnSummit & #BTT airdrop plan?  See you \\nthere at 8:00am, Jan 5th, 2019(PST) (4 hours la ter).  #TRON to the future.  #TRX.” \\n94. On January 20, 2019, the BitTorrent Foundation “unveil[ed] more details \\nregarding BitTorrent (BTT) airdrops for TRON (TRX) holders” in a post  to the @BitTorrent \\nMedium page.  Sun and the Tron Foundation e ach tweeted a link to the January 20, 2019, \\nMedium post, simultaneously announcing the plan to  “initiate [the] first airdrop of BitTorrent \\n$BTT to the TRON $TRX holders on February 11th, 2019.” \\n95. The January 20, 2019, Medium post announced, “On February 11th, 2019, \\nBitTorrent Foundation will initiate its first airdro p of BitTorrent (BTT) to TRON (TRX) holders.  \\nThe snapshot”—a complete record of TRX ownershi p as of a specific point in time prior to the \\nairdrop used to identify qualifyi ng airdrop recipients—“will be ta ken when TRON’s block height \\nreaches 6.6 million*.  Based on this snapshot, BitTo rrent Foundation will initiate its first airdrop \\nof 10,890,000,000 BitTorrent (BTT), correspond ing to 1.1% of total supply.” \\n96. The January 20, 2019, Medium post further announced, “Over the next 12 months \\nfollowing this initial airdrop, 11,880,000,000 BTT will be offered to TRX holders, corresponding to 1.2% of total supply.  In  2020, the BitTorrent Foundation will airdrop Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 23 of 50 2412,870,000,000 BTT, corresponding to 1.3% of the total supply, and over the ne xt six years, the \\npercentage airdropped will increase by 0.1% per year, reaching 1.7% in 2025.” \\n97. To receive BTT in these airdrops, recipien ts had to hold TRX tokens in “official \\nwallets relaying on TRON’s network,” or in accounts on crypto asse t trading platforms \\n“supporting the airdrops.”  As explained in the January 20, 2019, Medi um post, “If you are \\nholding TRX, you will be eligible for BTT airdr ops.  All official wallets relaying on TRON’s \\nnetwork and carrying TRX will be eligible for BTT airdrops corresponding to the amount they \\nare holding.  No minimum of TRX is required to qualify for BTT airdrops.”  \\n98. On February 11, 2019, @BitTorrent posted an update to its Medium page \\nannouncing that the “BitTorrent (BTT) Airdrop program for TRON (TRX) holders [has been] \\ninitiated.”  According to this post, “all the a ddresses running on TRON’s bl ockchain that have a \\nTRX balance greater than or equa l to 1 TRX” and all investors w ith “TRX stored on an exchange \\nor a wallet supporting the official airdr op program” would receive 0.1097681177 BTT for each \\nTRX held. \\n99. Following the first monthly BTT airdrops  to TRX holders on February 11, 2019, \\nfrom March 2019 through February 2020, the Sun Defendants airdropped an additional \\n990,000,000 additional BTT to TRX hol ders on or about the 11th day of each month.   \\n100. Two subsequent monthly airdrops of 1,072,500,000 BTT took place on April 11 \\nand May 11, 2020, before the @BitTorrent Medium page announced on June 13, 2020 the \\npremature end of the airdrop program: “Today, af ter 16 rounds of BTT airdrops, BitTorrent \\nSpeed enjoys over 12 million monthly active user s.  After discussions among the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, community developers, a nd community representatives, it is the community’s belief Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 24 of 50 25that the monthly BTT airdrop to TRX holders ha s achieved its goals, and will discontinue with \\nimmediate effect.”  \\n101. According to the June 13, 2020 post to @BitTorrent’s Medium page, “[t]hrough \\nMay 11, 2020, BTT [] completed 16 rounds of airdr ops to TRX holders, airdropping a total of \\n25,987,500,000 BTT out of the total pool of 99,990,000,000 BTT, allowing millions of TRX \\nholders to use BTT within th e BitTorrent ecosystem.”  \\n102. Anyone who purchased and held TRX in an  “official” wallet at the time of each \\nmonthly “snapshot” received BTT regardless of  their geographic location or country of \\ncitizenship.  U.S. persons were  not excluded from receiving, a nd in fact did receive, BTT \\nthrough the monthly airdrop program.  \\n103. In addition to the monthly airdrop program, the January 20, 2019 post to \\n@BitTorrent’s Medium page announced “plans to airdrop additional 99,990,000,000 BTT, during online and offline events, corresponding to 10%  of the total supply.”  Sun, the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, and Rainberry ultimate ly offered and sold some of these additional BTT through a \\nnumber of bounty programs, detailed below. \\n104. On February 27, 2019, in an “Ask Me A nything” (or “AMA”) session held on the \\nEnglish language Telegram channel of a crypto asset trading platform, Sun explained the purpose \\nof the monthly BTT airdrop to TRX holders: “This is a program to give ou r users early access to \\nour product, and to encourage them to stick with us for the long te rm.  We are not only \\nairdropping to TRX holders, but also giving the BTT token to BitTorrent users through the \\nclients.  We expect over 100M active users will  get to know about cryp tocurrency and the first \\none they will experience will be BTT.”  Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 25 of 50 26105. Sun emphasized the airdrop program’s pot ential to bring BitTorrent’s 100 million \\nusers into the crypto asset community: “We will provide BTT as an early access mechanism to the 100 million active users and most of them are not cryptocurrency users.  However, the 100 million users are the targeted users, and they share a lot of similarities with crypto users.  Firstly, they are interested in decent ralized technologies and are usin g peer-to-peer technology.  \\nSecondly, the majority of BitTorrent users are males between 25 and 35 years old, which is also \\na group very interested in cryptocurrency.  Therefore, when the 100 million users receive BTT airdrops, they will start to wonder what BTT is, and what cryptocurrency is, and start to \\ninvestigate.” \\n106. Sun also explained that the decision to ta rget BitTorrent’s users with a new token, \\nBTT, instead of TRX, was intended to avoid “dilu ting” TRX’s value for existing holders.  “The \\nBitTorrent user base is huge (~100M MAU), so  we can’t provide enough TRX to then bootstrap \\nthe economy without diluting the value of TRX, ” said Sun in his February 27, 2019, AMA.  \\n“Since BTT is a TRC-10 token, TRX and BTT are like a razor and a blade.  It’s really important \\nfor me to give access to BTT to the TRON community and reward the TRX holders so we decided to create a 6 years long program to airdr op 10% of the total circul ating supply which is \\npretty unique within the crypto space.  The more successful BTT is, the more successful TRX will \\nbe,” (emphasis added). \\n107. By acquiring and holding TRX tokens in exchange for the opportunity to receive \\nBTT through monthly airdrops, would-be BTT aird rop recipients provided the Sun Defendants \\nwith valuable consideration—(i) increased demand for TRX, (ii) further growth in TRX trading \\nvolume and liquidity on the second ary market, (iii) upward pressure on TRX’s secondary market Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 26 of 50 27price, (iv) promotion of BTT and the BitTorrent  platform to TRX’s existing base of engaged \\ncrypto asset investors, and (v) the rapid deve lopment of a secondary market for BTT.   \\nB. Offers and Sales of BTT in the “New Year 2020” Distribution \\n108. From on or about December 23, 2019, through January 1, 2020, the Sun \\nDefendants offered and sold BTT through an onlin e bounty program they referred to as the “New \\nYear 2020” distribution.  \\n109. To receive BTT in this distribution, pa rticipants had to follow BitTorrent on \\nTwitter, visit BitTorrent’s page on YouTube, s ubmit online an answer to the question “why do \\nyou use Bit Torrent?” and tag friends’ social me dia accounts—all forms of publicizing Rainberry \\nand BTT.  \\n110. To receive BTT in this distribution, partic ipants also had to have or establish a \\nBTT wallet address.  \\n111. The Sun Defendants announced this di stribution in a December 22, 2019, post to \\nthe @BitTorrent Medium page: “[t]o celebrate the coming of exciting 2020 year, BitTorrent \\ndecides to give away 7 million BTT to BitTorrent community, in cluding a special big prize for \\nthis Christmas.  Each day during the event, 10 wi nners will be drawn from the selected entries, \\nstarting on December 23th.  Becau se the drawing is done randomly and each user is allowed \\nmultiple entries (see “rules” below), you could wi n multiple days, or even multiple times each \\nday!” \\n112. According to this Medium post, 10 winners chosen daily between December 23, \\n2019, and January 1, 2020, would each received 5 0,000 BTT, with the exception of 10 winners \\non chosen on December 25, 2019, who would receive “a  special big prize for this Christmas” of \\n250,000 BTT each. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 27 of 50 28113. On December 23, 2019, @BitTorrent also announced the distribution on Twitter, \\nwith a link to the December 22, 2019, Medium post , as well as a link to a website hosted by a \\nthird party that describes itself as “The Business Growth Platform,” where participants could \\nsubmit contest entries. \\n114. According to the entry submission page , 40,484 complete entries were received. \\n115. By completing the steps required to en ter, participants provided the Sun \\nDefendants with valuable consideration, includ ing advertising and publicity for Rainberry and \\nBTT, as well as social media handles for entran ts and the friends they tagged.  In addition, \\nparticipants who had not yet esta blished a BitTorrent account a nd corresponding wallet first had \\nto do so, increasing the apparent number of ac tive BitTorrent users and BTT wallet holders.  \\n116. None of the Sun Defendants took any steps to exclude U.S. persons from \\nreceiving BTT in this offering.  \\nC. Offers and Sales of BTT in the BitTorrent “Discord Giveaway” \\n117. From on or about March 3, 2021, through March 15, 2021, the Sun Defendants \\noffered and sold BTT through a bounty program th ey referred to as a “Discord Giveaway.”  \\n118. On or about March 3, 2021, @BitTorrent announced this distribution on Twitter: \\n“#BitTorrent Discord is now offi cially launched!  With the launc h of our Discord, we prepared 1 \\nBillion $BTT for winners who completed our reques ts, join here,” with a link to a third party \\nwebsite where participants could submit contest entries.  \\n119. To receive BTT in this contest, particip ants had to join the BitTorrent Discord \\nchannel,4 submit entry information on a third-party plat form, and engage with BitTorrent’s social',\n",
       " 'FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF ': '176. As illustrated in the tables above, the two account pairs—(1) Accounts 16 and 17 \\nand (2) the Activity and Bancor Accounts—enga ged in numerous wash trades of TRX.   \\n177. As reflected in a December 2018 applicati on filed by the BitTorrent Foundation to \\nmake BTT available for trading on a new trad ing platform, the BitTorrent Foundation also \\nowned and controlled Accounts 16 and 17. \\n178. At all relevant times, Sun, acting th rough the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, and Rainberry, controlled each of the wash trading accounts, and the trades of TRX \\nin those accounts were executed at Sun’s directio n and with his knowledge.  None of the TRX \\ntrades between those accounts invo lved any change in beneficial ownership or had any legitimate \\neconomic purpose. \\nVI. The Sun Defendants Orchestrated a Cele brity Touting Campaign and Lied \\nto Conceal It \\n179. Beginning in or about January 2021, Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron \\nFoundation, the BitTorrent Founda tion, and Rainberry, began payi ng celebrities, including Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 41 of 50 42Defendants Mahone and Way, among others, to promote TRX and B TT on social media.  Each \\nof the celebrities who touted TRX or BTT had at least one million followers on their social media accounts.  But the celebrities did not disclose the fact that th ey were paid to tout TRX or \\nBTT or the amounts of the payments they received. \\n180. Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron Founda tion, the BitTorrent  Foundation, and \\nRainberry, approved the payments to the celebritie s for their touts of TR X or BTT, respectively, \\nand he funded the payments with his own asse ts.  Sun sent the payments to a Rainberry \\nemployee (the “Rainberry Employee”), who in turn sent funds to an offshore intermediary who was responsible for lining up celebrities to tout  TRX or BTT.  Additionally, Sun instructed the \\nRainberry Employee to ensure that those celebrities did not disclose the fact  that they were paid \\nto tout the tokens.  Sun’s dire ctive was communicated to the cele brities directly or indirectly \\nthrough intermediaries, including the Rainberry Employee.   \\n181. Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at his direction, each acting on behalf of \\nthe Tron Foundation, the BitTorre nt Foundation, and Rainberr y, provided or approved the \\nspecific language that Sun wanted each celebrity to post online to tout TR X and BTT.  Sun then \\namplified the celebrities’ promotional posts on social media by commenting on those posts or \\nretweeting them to Sun’s more than  three million Twitter followers.   \\n182. Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron Founda tion, the BitTorrent  Foundation, and \\nRainberry, thus created the misleading impression th at celebrities were independently interested \\nin investing in TRX and/or BTT.  In fact, the celebrities only touted TRX and/or BTT because \\nthey were paid to do so. \\n183. On or about January 22, 2021, Way tweeted :  “thanks guys, bought some … TRX \\n… 💪 what’s next? let’s go ✔.”  Later, on or about Ja nuary 29, 2021, Way tweeted:  “ ✔$trx = Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 42 of 50 43fast blockchain.”  The Tron Foundation, through e ither Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at \\nhis direction, provided the language for Way’s tw eets, and Sun arranged for Way to be paid \\n$10,000 for those tweets.  But neither  of Way’s tweets disc losed the fact that Way had been paid \\nto tout TRX or the amount of his payment. \\n184. On or about February 11, 2021, an act ress tweeted:  “Exploring #DeFi and \\nalready liking $JST, $SUN on $TRX .  Super fast and 0 fee.  G ood job @ justinsuntron.”  That \\nsame day, another actress tweeted:  “People should use only $TRX cause it’s fast, cheap and hot \\n. . . thanks @justinsuntron.”  The Tron Founda tion, through either Sun or the Rainberry \\nEmployee acting at his direction, provided the language  for each of those tweets.  Also that same \\nday, a singer tweeted:  “What’s an ideal crypto ba g?  Thinking $TRX $BTT $JST $SUN $WIN.”  \\nThe Tron Foundation and BitTorrent Foundation, th rough either Sun or th e Rainberry Employee \\nacting at his direction, provided the language for each of those tw eets.  Sun arranged for these \\nthree celebrities to be pa id $10,000, $955.70, and $12,000, respectively, for their tweets.  None \\nof those tweets, however, disclosed the fact that the celebrities were paid to tout TRX or BTT or \\nthe amounts the payments.   \\n185. The next day, on or about February 12, 2021, Mahone tweeted:  “When $TRX \\nhits 50 cents and $BTT hits 1 cent I’m getting a tattoo of @justinsuntron’s face.”  The Tron \\nFoundation and BitTorrent Foundation, through either  Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at \\nhis direction, provided the language for Mahone ’s tweet, and Sun arranged for Mahone to be \\npaid Bitcoin valued at $20,059 for the tweet.  Mahone ’s tweet did not disclose the fact that he \\nhad been paid to tout TRX or BTT or the amount of his payment.   \\n186. To conceal the truth about the celebrity touting campaign from the investing \\npublic, Sun falsely denied that he  and the Tron Foundation paid celebr ities to tout.  On or about Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 43 of 50 44February 16, 2021, Sun tweeted:  “There have been rumors lately of third party celebrities being \\npaid to promote #TRON.  #TR ON Foundation is not i nvolved in these activities.  Nor is the \\nfoundation aware of the actors behind this.”  That same day, about one minute later, Sun \\ntweeted:  “If any celebrities are paid to prom ote TRON, we require them to disclose.”   \\n187. Those tweets by Sun were false.  In fact, as Sun knew, celebrities were paid to \\ntout TRX and BTT; the Tron Foundation and BitT orrent Foundation, through either Sun or the \\nRainberry Employee acting at his direction, provi ded the language for the touts; Sun arranged \\nand funded payments to the celebrities for the tout s; and the celebrities di d not disclose the fact \\nthat they were paid to tout TRX or  BTT or the amounts of their payments.',\n",

This action arises from Defendant Jus tin Sun’s (“Sun”) or chestration of the \\nunregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities. \\n2. Working through several companies that  he owns and controls—including \\nDefendants Tron Foundation Limited (“Tron Foundation”), BitTorrent Foundation Ltd. \\n(“BitTorrent Foundation”), and Rainberry, Inc. (“ Rainberry,” and collectively with Sun, the Tron \\nFoundation, and the BitTorrent Foundation, the “S un Defendants”)—Sun e ngineered the offer \\nand sale of two crypto asset securities called “TRX” and “B TT.”  Starting around August 2017, \\nand continuing thereafter, the Sun Defendants engage d in a scheme to distribute billions of TRX \\nand BTT to the public while also creating ac tive secondary markets on which TRX and BTT \\ncould be traded.   Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 1 of 50 23. The Sun Defendants offered and sold TRX and BTT as securities and were thus \\nrequired to register those offers and sales with the SEC unless an  exemption from registration was \\navailable.  But they never did so.  Despite engagi ng in widespread public offers and sales of TRX \\nand BTT, and even thou gh no exemption from registration wa s available, neith er Sun nor his \\nentities ever filed a registration statemen t with the SEC. \\n4. Sun also directed the manipul ative wash trading of TRX to create the artificial \\nappearance of legitimate investor interest and k eep TRX’s price afloat.  Su n accomplished this wash \\ntrading through: the Tron Foundati on, whose employees conducted the trades at Sun’s direction; the \\nBitTorrent Foundation, which, together with th e Tron Foundation, owned and controlled nominee \\naccounts used in the trading; an d Rainberry, whose empl oyees transferred funds  to facilitate the \\ntrading and opened at l east one nominee account used in the trading.  Sun’s wa sh trading team, \\nworking under his direction, engaged in hundred s of thousands of TRX wash trades between \\naccounts that Sun ultimately contro lled.  None of those trades i nvolved any change in beneficial \\nownership or had any legitimate economic purpose. \\n5. To drive public interest in  TRX and BTT, the Sun Defe ndants created a publicity \\ncampaign that involved paying celebrities, incl uding Defendants Austin  Mahone (“Mahone”) and \\nDeAndre Cortez Way (“Way”), amo ng others, to promote or tout TRX and BTT on their social \\nmedia accounts, which had millions of followers.  Although the celebrities were paid to promote \\nTRX and BTT, their touts on social media did not disclose that they had been paid or the amounts of \\ntheir payments.  Thus, the public  was misled into believing that  these celebrities had unbiased \\ninterest in TRX and BTT, and were not merely paid spokespersons.   \\n6. Additionally, Sun materially misrepresented the truth about the touting campaign \\nto deceive investors.  In Februa ry 2021, Sun stated falsely on soci al media, “If any celebrities are Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 2 of 50 3paid to promote TRON, we require them to di sclose.”  In fact, Sun himself arranged the \\npayments to celebrities and knew those payments were not disclosed.   \\n7. By their conduct alleged he rein, the Sun Defendants viol ated registration and anti-\\nfraud provisions of the Se curities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), specifically Sections 5(a) and \\n(c), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a)  and (c), and S ections 17(a)(1) and (3 ) of the Securities Ac t, 15 U.S.C. §§ \\n77q(a)(1) and (3).  They  also violated anti-mani pulation and anti-fraud provi sions of the Securities \\nand Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”),  specifically Sections 9(a )(1) and (2), 15 U.S.C. \\n§§ 78i(a)(1) and (2), and Section 10(b) of the Exch ange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 \\nthereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.  Additionally, they  aided and abetted violations of the anti-\\ntouting provision, Section 17(b) of the S ecurities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(b), by multiple \\ncelebrities, including Mahone and Way. \\n8. By their conduct alleged herein, Mah one and Way violated the anti-touting \\nprovision, Section 17(b) of the Secu rities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(b). \\n9. Unless restrained and enjoin ed, Defendants will  continue to violate the federal \\nsecurities laws. \\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\n10. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections \\n20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a), and Sections \\n21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Ac t, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a). \\n11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over De fendants, and venue is proper in this \\nDistrict pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securi ties Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of \\nthe Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because, among other things, some of Defendants’ acts and transactions that violated the federal securiti es laws occurred in this District.  For example, Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 3 of 50 4the Sun Defendants offered and sold TRX and/or BTT in unregistered securities transactions to \\ninvestors who resided in this  District.  Additionally, the touting tweets by Mahone and Way \\ndescribed herein were sent to Twitter users ac ross the country, including in this District. \\nDEFENDANTS \\n12. Defendant Justin Sun  (a/k/a Yuchen Sun), age 32, is a Chinese national and \\ncrypto asset entrepreneur.  Sun attended colleg e in China and received a post-graduate degree \\nfrom the University of Pennsylvania.  Sun is cu rrently the Permanent Representative of Grenada \\nto the World Trade Organization and is believed to be living in Singapore and/or Hong Kong.  At \\nall relevant times, Sun acted through, on behalf of, and for th e benefit of the Tron Foundation, \\nthe BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry.  \\n13. Defendant Tron Foundation Limited  was founded by Sun in 2017 as a \\nSingapore Public Company Limited by Guarantee.  The Tron Foundation is one of several alter-\\nego entities organized by Sun through which he conducted the TRX and BTT offerings and \\nmanaged the development and marketing of the Tron ecosystem.  From 2017 to the present, Sun \\nhas owned and controlled the Tron Foundation.    \\n14. Defendant BitTorrent Foundation Ltd.  (sometimes d/b/a BitTorrent) was \\nfounded by Sun in October 2018 as a Singapore P ublic Company Limited by Guarantee.  The \\nBitTorrent Foundation is one of  several alter-ego entities orga nized by Sun, including the Tron \\nFoundation, through which he conducted the B TT offerings and managed, together with \\nRainberry, Inc., the development and marketing of  the BitTorrent protocol.  From 2018 to the \\npresent, Sun has owned and contro lled the BitTorrent Foundation.  \\n15. Defendant Rainberry, Inc. (sometimes d/b/a BitTorrent) is a California \\ncorporation owned and managed by Sun.  The co rporation was founded in 2004 and operated as Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 4 of 50 5BitTorrent, Inc. until June 2018, when it was acquired by Sun and renamed Rainberry, Inc.  \\nFrom 2018 to the present, Sun has owned and cont rolled Rainberry and is its only shareholder \\nand officer.  \\n16. Defendant Austin Mahone , age 26, is a U.S. citizen and a singer and songwriter \\nresiding in Miami, Florida.  At  or around the time of his releva nt actions alleged herein, Mahone \\nhad approximately 9.1 million followers on Twitter.  \\n17. Defendant DeAndre Cortez Way  (a/k/a Soulja Boy), age 32, is a U.S. citizen \\nand a singer and record producer re siding in Calabasas, California.  At or around the time of his \\nrelevant actions alleged herein, Way had approximately 5.2 million followers on Twitter.  \\nBACKGROUND ON SECU RITIES OFFERINGS \\n18. Congress enacted the Securities Act to regulate the offer a nd sale of securities.  In \\ncontrast to commercial principles of caveat emptor  (or buyer beware), Congress in the Securities \\nAct enacted a regime of full and fair disclosure , requiring those who offer and sell securities to \\nthe investing public to provide sufficient, accu rate information to allow investors to make \\ninformed decisions before they invest. \\n19. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securitie s Act generally require an issuer of \\nsecurities to register an offe ring of securities through an effec tive registration statement before \\nthe securities are offered and sold to the public.  See 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and (c).  Registration \\nstatements for a securities offe ring provide public investors with material information about the \\nissuer and the securities to be offered and sold. \\n20. Section 2(a)(1) of the Securi ties Act defines “security” to include a wide range of \\ninvestment vehicles, including an “investment contra ct.”  15 U.S.C. § 77b(a )(1).  An investment \\ncontract, for purposes of the Securities Act, in cludes any “contract, tr ansaction or scheme Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 5 of 50 6whereby a person invests his money in a common en terprise and is led to expect profits” from \\nthe efforts of others.  SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. , 328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946).  This broad \\ndefinition is “flexible” and “cap able of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes \\ndevised by those who seek the use of the mone y of others on the promise of profits.”  Id. at 299.  \\nCourts have found that many types of investme nts, including crypto assets, may constitute \\ninvestment contracts and thus securities.  See, e.g. , SEC v. Kik Interactive Inc. , 492 F. Supp. 3d \\n169, 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (holding th at certain crypto assets were  sold as securities in \\nunregistered transactions).  \\n21. In analyzing whether something is a s ecurity, “form should be disregarded for \\nsubstance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight , 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on \\neconomic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.”  United \\nHousing Found., Inc. v. Forman , 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975). \\nBACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS \\n22. The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/ or transferred using \\ndistributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as \\n“cryptocurrencies,” “digital assets,” “virtual curre ncies,” “digital coins,” and “digital tokens.” \\n23. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a \\nnetwork of computers that records all transact ions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally \\nrecorded data packages.  The system relies on cryptographic techniques fo r secure recording of \\ntransactions. \\n24. Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” transactions, \\nwhich, among other things, aims to  achieve agreement on a data value or on the state of the \\nledger.  Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 6 of 50 7crypto assets; they may also be also be purchased or sold from the platform in exchange for fiat \\ncurrency (legal tender issued by a country). \\n25. A blockchain “protocol” is a code, so ftware, or algorithm that governs how a \\nblockchain, or a feature of a blockchain, operates, including, among other things, the validation \\nmechanism used for the particular blockchain. \\n26. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued the Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section \\n21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO , advising “those who would use . . . \\ndistributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising[] to take  appropriate steps to \\nensure compliance with the U.S. federal securiti es laws,” and finding that the offering of crypto \\nassets at issue in that report involved investment contracts and thus securities. \\nFACTS \\nI. Sun and the Tron Foundation Launched TRX and Promoted It as an \\nInvestment  \\nA. Sun and the Tron Foundation Esta blished the Tron “Ecosystem” \\n27. No later than June 2017, Sun and the Tron Foundation began promoting the Tron \\n“ecosystem”—i.e., a group of blockchain protocols,  software code, and crypto assets controlled \\nby Sun and the Tron Foundation—through a series of  “whitepapers” that they posted on the \\ninternet.  The whitepapers often referred simply to “Tron” as a shorthand for the ecosystem that \\nSun and the Tron Foundation controlled.  The white papers were aimed at the investing public, \\nincluding investors in the United States.  At all relevant times, Sun and the Tron Foundation \\ncontrolled and had ultimate authority over the statements made in the whitepapers.  \\n28. On or about August 22, 2017, Sun a nd the Tron Foundation posted Tron \\nWhitepaper Version 1.7 (the “TRX Whitepape r”) on the internet.  The TRX Whitepaper \\nexplained that “TRON is a blockchain-based dece ntralized protocol that aims to construct a Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 7 of 50 8worldwide free content entertainment system w ith the blockchain and distributed storage \\ntechnology.”  The TRX Whitepaper further explai ned that Tron’s protocol allowed users to \\npublish, store, and own data, and to participat e in “a decentralized content entertainment \\necosystem.”   \\n29. Additionally, the TRX Whitepaper st ated that the Tron Foundation was \\nestablished “to operate [the] TRON network.”   \\nB. Sun and the Tron Foundation Mark eted TRX as an Investment \\nBefore Its ICO \\n30. Sun and the Tron Foundation used the TR X Whitepaper to, among other things, \\nentice investors to purchase “TRX ” (also known as “TRONIX”), a cr ypto asset that Sun and the \\nTron Foundation called the “Official Token of TRON.”  The TRX Whitepaper made clear that \\n“[t]hose who wish to enter” the Tron ecosystem “must buy” TRX.  \\n31. The TRX Whitepaper promoted an upcoming initial coin offering (“ICO”) of \\nTRX, comprising forty percent of the 100 b illion total TRX supply.  The TRX Whitepaper \\nexplained that thirty-five percent of the re maining TRX would be allocated to the “TRON \\nFoundation and the ecosystem,” fifteen percent woul d be allocated to a “[p]rivate offering,” and \\nten percent would be allocated to “Peiwo Hu anle (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd.” (“Peiwo”), \\nanother Chinese company that Sun founded, owned and controlled.  \\n32. The TRX Whitepaper also promoted the pr ofit potential for investors in TRX.  \\nFor example, it stated: Purchase rs of TRX could “share [in] dividend growth ”; Tron’s ecosystem \\nwas designed for TRX “holders wh o [are] optimistic about TRON on a long-term basis ”; “those \\nwho hold and lock [TRX] for [the] long[-term] will be rewarded ”; “[l]ong-term investment ” was \\n“critical;” “stakeholders enjoy . . . sustainable growth ”; and “ [l]ong-term holding  of stakeholders Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 8 of 50 9[would] be the benchmark in the ecosystem and better lead the development of the ecology.”  \\n(Emphasis added.)  \\n33. The TRX Whitepaper also promoted the executive team whose efforts would \\nsupposedly lead to TRX’s success.  For example, the TRX Whitepaper listed Sun as the “Founder and Chief Executive Officer” and highli ghted Sun’s prior experience working for \\nanother crypto asset company, sta ting that the “market value of [t he company] has exceeded ten \\nbillion US dollars.”  Simila rly, the TRX Whitepaper spotlig hted other team members, \\nemphasized their credentials, and stated that the “TRON founding team will spare no efforts to \\nrealize the development goal proposed in the wh ite paper and expand the growth” of the Tron \\necosystem.   \\n34. The TRX Whitepaper and similar, later wh itepapers promoting TRX that Sun and \\nthe Tron Foundation issued, remain  on the internet and availabl e to investors to this day.  \\n35. From about August through Septem ber 2017, Sun and the Tron Foundation \\nconducted the TRX ICO, offering and selling TRX to numerous purchasers who paid crypto \\nassets—including Bitcoin (“BTC”) and Ether (“ETH ”)—in exchange for TRX.  In the ICO, 40% \\nof the total available supply of TRX was offe red, sold, and otherwise distributed, with the \\nremaining TRX allocated for distribution in th e proportions listed in the TRX Whitepaper—35% \\nto the Tron Foundation and Tron ecosystem; 15% fo r distribution in a “private offering”; and \\n10% to Peiwo.  Sun owned and/or controlled  the Tron Foundation and Peiwo, and thus he \\neffectively retained control over at least the 45% of TRX allocat ed to these entities.  \\nC. Sun and the Tron Foundation Sought to Create a Secondary Market for \\nTRX While Continuing to Prom ote TRX as an Investment \\n36. The “Trading Platform” is a crypto asse t trading platform based in the United \\nStates.  On or about March 1, 2018, Sun and th e Tron Foundation took step s to get the Trading Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 9 of 50 10Platform to make TRX available for trading by its  customers, including in vestors in the U.S.  \\nThat day, the Trading Platform announced publ icly on Twitter that TRX was “available for \\ntrading.”  Thereafter, Sun and the Tron F oundation publicly promoted each time TRX was \\n“listed”—or made available fo r trading—on a new crypto asset trading platform, including the \\n“listing” on a second U.S.-based platform on or  about March 25, 2019.  From on or about March \\n1, 2018 through approximately July 2021, Sun and the Tron Foundation tweeted more than 200 \\ntimes promoting the availability of TRX for trading on crypto asset trading platforms.  \\n37. Sun and the Tron Foundation also made ot her public statements promoting TRX \\nas an investment.  For example, on or about March 17, 2018, Sun and the Tron Foundation \\nposted on the U.S.-based digital publishing platfo rm Medium a link to an article titled “4 \\nReasons to Invest in Tron, Before the Main Net Launch.”  The articl e explained that ongoing \\nefforts by Sun and the Tron Foundation “will boost th e value of TRX” and st ated that investors \\n“should invest now, while [they] still can.”  Th e article further advise d investors “considering \\ninvesting in TRX” that “now is one of the best times to do it,” and that “[b]uying TRX now, \\nwhile its [sic] cheap, could lead to serious retu rns after the Tron Main Net launches and investors \\nrush to fill their bags.”  \\n38. Sun and the Tron Foundation specifically targ eted investors in the United States.  \\nFor example, on or about September 18, 2018, the Tron Foundation tweeted, “[y]ou can now buy \\n$TRX directly with USD on @BittrexExchange.”  That tweet linked to a Global Coin Report \\npost stating, “[T]his is the first time that Tron has been pa ired with the USD in the United \\nStates.”   Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 10 of 50 1139. That same day, Sun tweeted, “#TRX already can be traded on @BittrexExchange, \\n$USD markets, $USD/ $TRX.  Firs t #TRX fiat trading pair in US .  Go #TRON.  Go #TRONICS.  \\n#TRON to the future.”  \\n40. On or about December 15, 2019, Sun retwee ted a post from another individual, \\nwhich stated that investors in the United St ates could trade TRX “pretty much everywhere, \\nespecially with a VPN.”1  Sun’s retweet announced, “[w]e w ill make $TRX available for all \\n[U.S.] users!  More options are on the way!”  Sun and the Tr on Foundation worked with crypto \\nasset trading platforms to made TRX widely av ailable for trading by investors in the United \\nStates, who can still trade TRX on at least four U.S.-based platforms.  \\n41. Sun and the Tron Foundation regularly publicized their ongoing efforts to \\nincrease TRX’s value.  For instance, in an  interview posted on November 30, 2017 to the \\nMedium page of a popular investor  in crypto assets, Sun promoted  TRX’s availability for trading \\non four crypto asset trading platforms, and repres ented that “team is working hard on getting on \\nbigger exchanges.”   \\n42. In the same interview, Sun described a six-stage “roadmap” for future \\ndevelopment, committing his team to a nearly eight-year development schedule.  “The roadmap is on the official website, there are six stag es, Exodus, Odyssey, Great Voyage, Apollo Star, \\nTrek, Eternity.  For now, we plan to make Pe iwo APP compatible with TRX and complete the \\ndevelopment of our own main chain.  After th e own main chain is done, we will optimize the \\nnetwork based [sic] different kinds of online entertainments applications.” \\n                                                 \\n1  A VPN or virtual private network uses encryption over  a public network, typically the internet, to create a \\nsecure, apparently private network.  Using a VPN allows a user to hide the public IP address of their device and, \\ndepending on the provider, may allow a user to select an “exit node” in a specific country or geographic region, \\nhiding their actual location. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 11 of 50 1243. Sun and the Tron Foundation also widely publicized their efforts to manage the \\nsupply of TRX to ensure price appreciation for the benefit of TRX investors.  For example, on or \\nabout June 26, 2018, Sun tweeted that “#TRON comple ted Coin Burn of 1 billion #TRX,” with a \\nlink to a Tron Foundation Medium post explaining that “‘Coin burn’ refers to removing tokens \\nfrom the total supply” and “encourages a fair distribution of cryptocu rrency, helps to control \\ninflation and reward[s] token hol ders” because reducing the total supply of TRX would typically \\nincrease the value of TRX remaining in the market.  \\n44. Later, on or about December 19, 2017, the Tron Foundation posted an \\n“Announcement to Our Investors ” (emphasis added) on its Medium  page, stating that “[t]he \\n34.2518% TRX held by Tron Foundation . . . had alrea dy being locked [sic] up until January 1st, \\n2020,” and assuring investors that “Tron Foundation TRX will not be withdrawn or traded.”  The \\nTron Foundation concluded this post by stating, “[ w]e are working hard in order to provide \\nsecurity and supervision of all our investors, su pporters and believers.” \\n45. Then, on or about June 26, 2019, the Tron Foundation posted to Medium an \\n“Announcement on $20 Million TRX Buy-back Pl an and 2020 TRX Holding Plan,” which \\ndetailed a plan to “conduct by fa r the largest TRX buy-back . . . w ith the widest coverage in the \\nsecondary market, which will last for a year and will be conducted in several batches with no less \\nthan $20 million.”  The stated purpose of this plan was “to promote community activity and market stability.”  The Medium post also assu red investors that “[t]he [Tron] “Foundation will \\ncontinue to increase our TRX holdi ngs in the secondary market to manifest our confidence in the \\ndevelopment of the TRON ecosystem.”  Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 12 of 50 1346. On or about June 27, 2019, Sun tweeted about the $20 million TRX buyback and \\nincluded a link to an article on cointelegraph.com reiterating th e details previously posted to \\nMedium.  \\nII. Sun and the Tron Foundation Engaged in Unregistered TRX Offers and \\nSales \\n47. TRX was offered and sold as a security, sp ecifically as an investment contract.  \\nAll TRX purchasers, including those who tendere d value for TRX other than cash or crypto \\nassets, invested in a common enterprise alongs ide Sun and the Tron Founda tion, who at all times \\nretained significant TRX holdings.  Because the value of TRX rose or fell together for all \\nholders, all TRX holders profited or suffered losses in amounts proportionate to their TRX \\nholdings.  As such, their fortunes—including the real ization of future profits—were inextricably \\ntied to Sun’s fortunes and to each other’s.  A nd, given widespread prom otional statements by \\nSun and the Tron Foundation emphasizing the Foundation’s TRX holdings, TRX purchasers \\nreasonably expected their fortunes to be inextr icably tied to those of Sun, the Tron Foundation, \\nand each other.  \\n48. All TRX purchasers’ and holders’ prosp ective profits also depended largely on \\nefforts by Sun and the Tron Foundation to devel op the Tron protocol, make TRX available for \\ntrading on crypto asset trading platforms, and pr omote TRX to potential investors so as to \\nincrease its secondary market price for all holders.  And, given Sun and the Tron Foundation’s \\npromotional statements, TRX purchasers and holder s reasonably expected th at the value of their \\ninvestment would largely rise or  fall on these efforts to increase TRX’s valueFrom at least March \\n2018 through February 2019, Sun and the Tron Founda tion offered and sold TRX in three types \\nof unregistered securities tr ansactions, described below. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 13 of 50 1449. No registration statement was ever filed with  the SEC or in effect with respect to \\nany of these offers and sales of TRX, and no ex emption from registration was available for these \\noffers and sales of TRX.  Thus, the offers and sales of TRX descri bed below violated the \\nregistration provisions of the fede ral securities laws.       \\nA. Offers and Sales of TRX on a U.S.-B ased Crypto Asset Trading Platform \\n50. From on or about March 12, 2018, through February 11, 2019, Sun and the Tron \\nFoundation offered and sold approximately 542.6 million TRX to investors, including U.S. \\npersons who placed their orders on the Trading Plat form while in the United States.  Those sales \\ngenerated net proceeds of more than $31.9 million for Sun and the Tron Foundation.  \\nB. Offers and Sales of TRX in the Tron “Emoji Contest” \\n51. Between August 13, 2018, and August 28, 2018, Sun and the Tron Foundation \\noffered and sold 50,000 TRX through an online bount y program, pursuant to which Sun and the \\nTron Foundation transferred TRX to certain partic ipants in exchange for completing specific \\ntasks promoting TRX or the Tron Foundation.  They referred to this specific bounty program as \\nan “emoji contest,” which required particip ants to “TELL A STOR Y ABOUT TRON WITH \\nEMOJIS” by posting and sharing on Facebook and/ or Twitter original compositions using \\n“TRON elements” and emojis.  \\n52. According to an August 13, 2018 post by the Tron Foundation to its blog on \\nMedium , creators of so-called “outstanding works,” sp ecifically “the top 6 works with the most \\nlikes and shares on both Twitter and Face book” would be rewarded with 31,000 TRX—16,000 \\nTRX to the first place winner, and 3,000 TRX each to five runners-up.  Another 5,000 TRX \\nwould be distributed to randomly selected part icipants who met the contest requirements but \\nwere not selected as winners based on the number of “likes and shares” received.  Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 14 of 50 1553. Sun posted a link to the Medium announ cement on his own Twitter feed, writing \\n“#TRON EMOJI CONTEST: No text, no sound, creatively tell your story with the #TRON \\nemoji, check out the deta ils and earn $TRX #TRX.”  \\n54. To enter the “emoji contest,” participants  had to upload their submissions to \\nTwitter and/or Facebook with the hashtag #TRONFUN, and tag (or “@”) ten friends as well as \\n@tronfoundation.  Friends tagged in  the winning submissions woul d also receive TRX, with \\n4,000 TRX to be shared equally by the ten friend s of the first place winner, and 100 TRX to be \\ndistributed to each of the ten fr iends tagged by the five runners-up.  \\n55. The announcement also stated that “[w]orks  and pictures of the winners will be \\nposted on TRON official website and official Twitter account.” \\n56. By entering the “emoji contest,” part icipants provided Sun and the Tron \\nFoundation with valuable consideration—the on line promotion of the Tron platform and TRX \\necosystem, promotional artwork to feature on the Tron website, and the Twitter and Facebook \\nhandles of entrants and their tagged friends—i n exchange for an opportunity to receive TRX.  \\n57. In total, Sun and the Tron Foundation distributed 50,000 TRX to winners of the \\n“emoji contest.”   \\n58. Neither Sun nor his entities  took any steps to exclude U.S. persons from receiving \\nTRX in this offering, and at least one of the wi nners who received TRX was a resident of this \\nDistrict.  \\nC. Offers and Sales of TRX in the “niTRON Sharing Campaign” \\n59. Between December 12, 2018, and December 16, 2018, Sun and the Tron \\nFoundation offered and sold 28,588 TRX through an online bounty program that required Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 15 of 50 16participants to retweet  and comment on the Tron Foundation’s tweet announcing the contest, and \\ninclude the hashtag “#niTRON.”   \\n60. According to the Tron Foundation’s tweeted  announcement, three second prize \\nwinners—to be selected from among all co ntest entrants—would be awarded 6,666 TRX each, \\nwhile five third prize winners would each re ceive 1,718 TRX.  Two firs t prize winners would \\nreceive tickets to attend the 2019 “niTron Summit ,” a Tron-sponsored gathering at the Yerba \\nBuena Art Center in San Francisco to “discu ss the current technologica l progress within the \\nindustry, the future of blockchain, and best practices to inspire others to empower the \\ndevelopment of blockchain.”  \\n61. By entering the niTRON sharing contest, participants provided Sun and the Tron \\nFoundation with valuable consideration—the pr omotion of the Tron Foundation and the niTRON \\nsummit on Twitter—in exchange for an opportunity to receive TRX.  \\n62. Neither Sun nor his entities  took any steps to exclude U.S. persons from receiving \\nTRX in this offering, and at least one of th e winners who received TRX was a U.S. person.  \\nIII. The Sun Defendants Launch BTT and Pr omote It as an Investment \\nA. Sun Acquires Rainberry and Incorporat es It into the Tron Ecosystem \\n63. In or about June 2018, Sun purchased BitTorrent, Inc., a company based in San \\nFrancisco, California.  BitTorrent, Inc.’s tec hnology allowed users to download and transfer \\ndigital data and files.  Sun changed the comp any’s name to Rainberry, although its promotional \\nmaterials often continue to refer to it as BitTorre nt.  Sun then used Rai nberry and the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, which he formed in October 2018, to offer and sell both the BitTorrent Token, a \\nnew crypto asset abbreviated as “BTT,” and TRX. \\n64. In a “Letter to the Community” posted to the Tron Foundation’s Medium page on \\nJuly 24, 2018, Sun announced “that TRON has su ccessfully acquired BitTorrent and all Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 16 of 50 17BitTorrent products.  From this day on, BitTorrent . . . will become part of the TRON ecosystem. \\n. . .  Through this acquisition, BitTorrent and TRON will combine forces, with the TRON US \\nteam merging with the BitTorrent team .  BitTorrent possesses worl d-class technical talent and \\nsolid experience in decentralized protocol techno logy.  Combining the robust capabilities of the \\ntwo teams will take the technology behind the TRON ecosystem to a whole new level.”  \\n(Emphasis added). \\n65. Sun, the Tron Foundation, and the BitT orrent Foundation posted similar \\nannouncements to their respective Twitter accounts.  \\n66. Consistent with Sun’s July 24, 2018 announcement, Rainberry’s operations \\nbecame intertwined with those of the Tron Foundation.  Rainberry employees and executives—who had previously used email addresses with  the “@BitTorrent” domai n—were provided with \\n“@tron.network” email addresses, and many Rainbe rry employees were tasked with working on \\nprojects related to the Tron Foundation.     \\n67. Sun and the Tron Foundation also began refe rring to key Rainbe rry personnel as \\n“Tron” employees on social media, and Rai nberry personnel and Sun, on behalf of the Tron \\nFoundation, the BitTorrent Founda tion, and Rainberry, began app earing at events like the \\n“niTron Summit,” discussed above, to publicize Tron and TRX alongside BitTorrent and BTT.  \\nB. The Sun Defendants Promoted BTT as an Investment \\n68. At all relevant times following his ac quisition of BitTorrent, Inc., Sun had \\nultimate authority over the BitTorrent F oundation and Rainberry’s social media accounts—\\nincluding the @BitTorrent Twitter and Medium accounts—a nd directed, controlled, and \\napproved posts made on these platforms. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 17 of 50 1869. On or about January 3, 2019, the Bi tTorrent Foundation and Rainberry \\nannounced, by tweet from the BitT orrent Foundation’s @BitTorrent  Twitter accoun t, the “new \\nBitTorrent $BTT” crypto asset, which “will be exclusively available to non-U.S. accounts on #BinanceLaunchpad, the token sale platform [ operated] by leading cryptocurrency exchange \\n@binance!”  \\n70. In a YouTube video posted on January 4, 2019, Sun—appearing with a Rainberry \\nexecutive from Rainberry’s San Fr ancisco headquarters—explained that the offer and sale of \\nBTT was an effort to “monetize BitTorrent with th e Bitcoin together.”  In this same video, Sun \\nacknowledged that issuing a new BTT crypto asset was intended to bring BitTorrent’s users and \\ntheir “billions of devices” into the Tron ecosystem .  Sun also stated that his goal was to get the \\n“tens of millions of [BitTorrent] users . . . interest ed in BTT or even crypto and then they will get \\nthe TRX wallet and then they will al so get into the Tron community.”   \\n71. The Sun Defendants scheduled the first offer and sale of BTT for late January \\n2019.  Around that time, the Sun Defendants posted to BitTorrent’s website a new whitepaper \\n(the “BTT Whitepaper”) to promote BTT to investor s.  Sun controlled and had ultimate authority \\nover the statements made in the BTT Whitepaper.  \\n72. The BTT Whitepaper stated that “[i] n 2018, BitTorrent formed a strategic \\npartnership with TRON,” and that the “T RON Foundation and BitTorrent Foundation are \\nintroducing a new cryptographic token, called B TT.”  The BTT Whitepaper further explained \\nthat BTT would be “made available as a divi sible token, allowing fo r granular pricing.”  \\n73. The BTT Whitepaper also promoted the initia l offering of BTT.  It explained that \\n990 billion BTT would be offered and sold, and that  the tokens would be distributed as follows:  \\n6% for public sale; 2% for private sale; 9% for “[s]eed sale”; 10.1% for “Tron airdrop tokens”; Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 18 of 50 1910% for “BitTorrent protocol aird rop tokens”; 19% for the “BitTorrent Team and the BitTorrent \\nFoundation”; 20% for the Tron Foundation; 19.9% fo r the “BitTorrent ecosystem”’ and 4% for \\n“[p]artnership tokens.”   \\n74. On or about January 29, 2019, the Sun Defe ndants publicly offered or caused to \\nbe offered BTT for the first time through a so-called initial exchange offering (“IEO”).  \\n75. Like ICOs, IEOs are offerings of crypto a ssets to raise capital.  However, IEOs \\nare conducted by crypto asse t trading platforms on behalf of crypto asset issuers—usually for a \\nfee—and immediately provide a secondary market for crypto asset purchasers.   \\n76. Only holders of TRX or of another sp ecifically-identified crypto asset were \\neligible to purchase BTT in the IEO, and all BTT tokens offered in the IEO were sold in less than \\nfifteen minutes.  \\n77. Soon after the IEO, on or about January 28, 2019, Sun tweeted:  “For those [who] \\ndidn’t get #BTT in the public sale, stay tuned for the #TRX airdrop!  Own[ing] $TRX will secure \\nyour chance to get $BTT! #TRON #BitTorrent.”  \\n78. As with TRX, the BTT Whitepaper, and similar, later whitepapers promoting \\nBTT, remained on the internet and available to investors from February 2019 through the \\npresent.  \\nC. The Sun Defendants Sought to Create a Secondary Market for BTT \\nTrading While Continuing to Promote It as an Investment \\n79. After the BTT IEO, the Sun Defenda nts, acting through the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, applied for and secured listings for BTT on various crypto asset trading platforms, \\nincluding the Trading Platform.   \\n80. Social media posts by each of the Sun Defendants created a reasonable \\nexpectation of profit for BTT investors.  For instance, immediately following the BTT IEO, on Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 19 of 50 20January 31, 2019, Sun tweeted that he had “[t]ak[en]  the humble approach and ke[pt] the initial \\nsale price low” to “benefit the community and reward them with decent return!”  The Sun \\nDefendants also promoted opportunities to profit  from “staking” BTT on various platforms, \\nincluding more than 40 tweets from January 2020 through May 2021, further promoting BTT as \\nan investment.2 \\n81. Later, around March 1, 2019, in a chat broadcast on Telegram,3 Sun stated that he \\nchose to offer and sell the new BTT tokens, rather  than more TRX, to avoid “diluting the value \\nof TRX.”  Sun also emphasized that his goal was to “increase[ e] the value of TRX and BTT.”  \\n82. Sun’s social media posts and public stat ements also highlighted increases in \\nBTT’s price and trading volume, thus promoti ng BTT trading.  For example, on May 6, 2019, \\nafter TRX fell from a list of “top 10 cryptocurrencie s,” Sun stoked continued interest in TRX and \\nBTT on Twitter, tweeting:  “#TRON will be back to Top 10 in June!  #BitTorrent will be Top 30 \\nin Q2.”  On May 29, 2019, Sun tweeted:  “Mission completed.  It is just a beginning.  More to \\ncome,” with a link to a post announcing that TRX had returned to the top 10 and BTT had \\nentered the top 30 cryptocurrencies. \\n83. The Sun Defendants announced other percei ved milestones for BTT trading in the \\nsecondary market.  For example, in May 2019, Sun tweeted: “$BTT hit the 2nd place with the \\nhighest price increase over the last 24 hours among the TOP100 #Cryptos by Market \\n                                                 \\n2  “Staking” concerns the “proof of stake” validation protocols that certain blockchains utilize.  These \\nprotocols offer rewards to those who “validate”—or confirm—transactions on the blockchain.  To become a \\nvalidator and obtain such rewards, holders of crypto asse ts must first “stake”—or commit—crypto assets (typically, \\nthe “native” crypto asset on a particular  blockchain).  Validators are selected based on the size of their stake, among \\nother factors, creating an incentive to stake, or commit, greater quantities of crypto assets.  The protocols incentivize \\nvalidators to add legitimate transactions to the blockchain because validators are rewarded  if they do and could be \\npenalized if they do not, including by having the staked crypto assets “slashed” (or destroyed). \\n3  Telegram is a cross-platform messaging application commonly used by crypto asset issuers and promoters \\nto disseminate information about crypto asset offers and sales to interested parties and potential investors. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 20 of 50 21Capitalization!”  Similarly, in February 2021, @B itTorrent tweeted that “$BTT Price Hits New \\nHigh.  $BTT grew + 151% in 24 hours, +232% in 7 days.  #BTT to the [sic] Mars,” with two \\nrocket emojis.   \\n84. The @BitTorrent Twitter account also promoted BTT’s “ROI” or “return on \\ninvestment” on social media, for example by re tweeting a post on July 2, 2019 comparing BTT’s \\n“current ROI” of “11.16x” to lower ROIs of othe r tokens also offered through IEOs.  Later, on \\nJuly 19, 2021, Rainberry promoted BTT’s second ary market performance, highlighting that \\n“[a]ccording to CryptoRank Platform, #BitTorrent  is Top 3 gainer with  751% profits in 2021.” \\n85. In addition to promoting the BTT secondary market, the Sun Defendants also \\nworked to make BTT available for trading on nume rous crypto asset trading platforms.  “Listing \\napplications” submitted to multiple crypto asset trading platforms, including the Trading Platform, listed the BitTorrent F oundation as the applicant.   \\n86. The Sun Defendants’ efforts to promote and grow a robust secondary market for \\ntrading in BTT were successful.  According to  a December 20, 2019 tweet by @BitTorrent, as of \\nthat date at least 39 crypto a sset trading platforms had made available BTT for trading. \\n87. The availability of BTT on numerous trad ing platforms allowed investors in the \\nU.S. to purchase and sell BTT, which they di d.  On January 5, 2019, Sun posted a livestream to \\nYouTube in which he encouraged U. S. investors to “use the Bitcoi n . . . or any cryptocurrency to \\nbuy the BTT in the future,” despite apparent restri ctions on U.S. investors’ participation in the \\nBTT IEO.  On May 11, 2021, the @BitTorrent Tw itter account posted a link to a video by “Mike \\nTha Investor” with information “for those who doesn’t [sic] know how to buy #BTT in the U.S.” \\nIV. The Sun Defendants Engaged in Unregistered BTT Offers and Sales \\n88. BTT was offered and sold as a security, sp ecifically as an i nvestment contract.  \\nAll BTT purchasers, including those who tendere d value for BTT other than cash or crypto Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 21 of 50 22assets, invested in a common enterprise alongside the Sun Defendants, who at all times retained \\nsignificant BTT holdings.  Because the value of BTT rose or fell together for all holders, all BTT \\nholders profited or suffered losses in amounts proportionate to their BTT holdings.  As such, \\ntheir fortunes—including the realization of future profits—were inextricably tied to those of the Sun Defendants and each other’s.   \\n89. BTT purchasers’ and holders’ prospective profits also depended largely on the \\nefforts of the Sun Defendants to develop the BitT orrent protocol, grow public interest in BTT \\nand TRX, take steps to make BTT available fo r trading on crypto asset trading platforms, and \\npromote BTT to potential investors so as to increase its secondary market price for all holders.  \\nAnd, given the Sun Defendants’ promotional stat ements, BTT purchasers and holders reasonably \\nexpected that the value of their investment would largely rise or fall on th ese efforts to increase \\nBTT’s valueFrom at least February 2019 thr ough October 2021, the Sun Defendants offered and \\nsold BTT in the 9 types of unregistered s ecurities transactions described below. \\n90. No registration statement was ever filed with  the SEC or in effect with respect to, \\nand no exemption from registration was available fo r, any of these offers and sales of BTT.  \\nThus, the offers and sales of BTT set forth be low violated the regist ration provisions of the \\nfederal securities laws. \\nA. Offers and Sales of BTT in Monthly “Airdrops” \\n91. From on or about February 11, 2019, through June 13, 2020, the Sun Defendants \\noffered and sold BTT through monthly so-called “airdrops” to TRX holders.  \\n92. In the crypto asset space, an airdrop typical ly refers to the distribution of crypto \\nassets to certain recipients, pur portedly without requiring them to  pay cash consideration for the \\nasset.  With respect to BTT, however, the recipien ts had to purchase and hold TRX to be eligible Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 22 of 50 23for airdrops of BTT.  Indeed, anyone who purchased and held TR X in a Tron digital wallet or on \\na participating crypto asset trading platform recei ved BTT regardless of their geographic location \\nor country of citizenship.  \\n93. On January 4, 2019, before the BTT IE O, Sun and the Tron Foundation both \\n“teased” the BTT monthly airdrop program to th eir followers, tweeting, “Keep decentralizing the \\nweb, tokenizing the world’s largest decentralized file sharing protocol.  Wanna know more about \\n#BTT @BitTorrent, #BinanceLaunchpad, #niTR OnSummit & #BTT airdrop plan?  See you \\nthere at 8:00am, Jan 5th, 2019(PST) (4 hours la ter).  #TRON to the future.  #TRX.” \\n94. On January 20, 2019, the BitTorrent Foundation “unveil[ed] more details \\nregarding BitTorrent (BTT) airdrops for TRON (TRX) holders” in a post  to the @BitTorrent \\nMedium page.  Sun and the Tron Foundation e ach tweeted a link to the January 20, 2019, \\nMedium post, simultaneously announcing the plan to  “initiate [the] first airdrop of BitTorrent \\n$BTT to the TRON $TRX holders on February 11th, 2019.” \\n95. The January 20, 2019, Medium post announced, “On February 11th, 2019, \\nBitTorrent Foundation will initiate its first airdro p of BitTorrent (BTT) to TRON (TRX) holders.  \\nThe snapshot”—a complete record of TRX ownershi p as of a specific point in time prior to the \\nairdrop used to identify qualifyi ng airdrop recipients—“will be ta ken when TRON’s block height \\nreaches 6.6 million*.  Based on this snapshot, BitTo rrent Foundation will initiate its first airdrop \\nof 10,890,000,000 BitTorrent (BTT), correspond ing to 1.1% of total supply.” \\n96. The January 20, 2019, Medium post further announced, “Over the next 12 months \\nfollowing this initial airdrop, 11,880,000,000 BTT will be offered to TRX holders, corresponding to 1.2% of total supply.  In  2020, the BitTorrent Foundation will airdrop Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 23 of 50 2412,870,000,000 BTT, corresponding to 1.3% of the total supply, and over the ne xt six years, the \\npercentage airdropped will increase by 0.1% per year, reaching 1.7% in 2025.” \\n97. To receive BTT in these airdrops, recipien ts had to hold TRX tokens in “official \\nwallets relaying on TRON’s network,” or in accounts on crypto asse t trading platforms \\n“supporting the airdrops.”  As explained in the January 20, 2019, Medi um post, “If you are \\nholding TRX, you will be eligible for BTT airdr ops.  All official wallets relaying on TRON’s \\nnetwork and carrying TRX will be eligible for BTT airdrops corresponding to the amount they \\nare holding.  No minimum of TRX is required to qualify for BTT airdrops.”  \\n98. On February 11, 2019, @BitTorrent posted an update to its Medium page \\nannouncing that the “BitTorrent (BTT) Airdrop program for TRON (TRX) holders [has been] \\ninitiated.”  According to this post, “all the a ddresses running on TRON’s bl ockchain that have a \\nTRX balance greater than or equa l to 1 TRX” and all investors w ith “TRX stored on an exchange \\nor a wallet supporting the official airdr op program” would receive 0.1097681177 BTT for each \\nTRX held. \\n99. Following the first monthly BTT airdrops  to TRX holders on February 11, 2019, \\nfrom March 2019 through February 2020, the Sun Defendants airdropped an additional \\n990,000,000 additional BTT to TRX hol ders on or about the 11th day of each month.   \\n100. Two subsequent monthly airdrops of 1,072,500,000 BTT took place on April 11 \\nand May 11, 2020, before the @BitTorrent Medium page announced on June 13, 2020 the \\npremature end of the airdrop program: “Today, af ter 16 rounds of BTT airdrops, BitTorrent \\nSpeed enjoys over 12 million monthly active user s.  After discussions among the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, community developers, a nd community representatives, it is the community’s belief Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 24 of 50 25that the monthly BTT airdrop to TRX holders ha s achieved its goals, and will discontinue with \\nimmediate effect.”  \\n101. According to the June 13, 2020 post to @BitTorrent’s Medium page, “[t]hrough \\nMay 11, 2020, BTT [] completed 16 rounds of airdr ops to TRX holders, airdropping a total of \\n25,987,500,000 BTT out of the total pool of 99,990,000,000 BTT, allowing millions of TRX \\nholders to use BTT within th e BitTorrent ecosystem.”  \\n102. Anyone who purchased and held TRX in an  “official” wallet at the time of each \\nmonthly “snapshot” received BTT regardless of  their geographic location or country of \\ncitizenship.  U.S. persons were  not excluded from receiving, a nd in fact did receive, BTT \\nthrough the monthly airdrop program.  \\n103. In addition to the monthly airdrop program, the January 20, 2019 post to \\n@BitTorrent’s Medium page announced “plans to airdrop additional 99,990,000,000 BTT, during online and offline events, corresponding to 10%  of the total supply.”  Sun, the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, and Rainberry ultimate ly offered and sold some of these additional BTT through a \\nnumber of bounty programs, detailed below. \\n104. On February 27, 2019, in an “Ask Me A nything” (or “AMA”) session held on the \\nEnglish language Telegram channel of a crypto asset trading platform, Sun explained the purpose \\nof the monthly BTT airdrop to TRX holders: “This is a program to give ou r users early access to \\nour product, and to encourage them to stick with us for the long te rm.  We are not only \\nairdropping to TRX holders, but also giving the BTT token to BitTorrent users through the \\nclients.  We expect over 100M active users will  get to know about cryp tocurrency and the first \\none they will experience will be BTT.”  Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 25 of 50 26105. Sun emphasized the airdrop program’s pot ential to bring BitTorrent’s 100 million \\nusers into the crypto asset community: “We will provide BTT as an early access mechanism to the 100 million active users and most of them are not cryptocurrency users.  However, the 100 million users are the targeted users, and they share a lot of similarities with crypto users.  Firstly, they are interested in decent ralized technologies and are usin g peer-to-peer technology.  \\nSecondly, the majority of BitTorrent users are males between 25 and 35 years old, which is also \\na group very interested in cryptocurrency.  Therefore, when the 100 million users receive BTT airdrops, they will start to wonder what BTT is, and what cryptocurrency is, and start to \\ninvestigate.” \\n106. Sun also explained that the decision to ta rget BitTorrent’s users with a new token, \\nBTT, instead of TRX, was intended to avoid “dilu ting” TRX’s value for existing holders.  “The \\nBitTorrent user base is huge (~100M MAU), so  we can’t provide enough TRX to then bootstrap \\nthe economy without diluting the value of TRX, ” said Sun in his February 27, 2019, AMA.  \\n“Since BTT is a TRC-10 token, TRX and BTT are like a razor and a blade.  It’s really important \\nfor me to give access to BTT to the TRON community and reward the TRX holders so we decided to create a 6 years long program to airdr op 10% of the total circul ating supply which is \\npretty unique within the crypto space.  The more successful BTT is, the more successful TRX will \\nbe,” (emphasis added). \\n107. By acquiring and holding TRX tokens in exchange for the opportunity to receive \\nBTT through monthly airdrops, would-be BTT aird rop recipients provided the Sun Defendants \\nwith valuable consideration—(i) increased demand for TRX, (ii) further growth in TRX trading \\nvolume and liquidity on the second ary market, (iii) upward pressure on TRX’s secondary market Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 26 of 50 27price, (iv) promotion of BTT and the BitTorrent  platform to TRX’s existing base of engaged \\ncrypto asset investors, and (v) the rapid deve lopment of a secondary market for BTT.   \\nB. Offers and Sales of BTT in the “New Year 2020” Distribution \\n108. From on or about December 23, 2019, through January 1, 2020, the Sun \\nDefendants offered and sold BTT through an onlin e bounty program they referred to as the “New \\nYear 2020” distribution.  \\n109. To receive BTT in this distribution, pa rticipants had to follow BitTorrent on \\nTwitter, visit BitTorrent’s page on YouTube, s ubmit online an answer to the question “why do \\nyou use Bit Torrent?” and tag friends’ social me dia accounts—all forms of publicizing Rainberry \\nand BTT.  \\n110. To receive BTT in this distribution, partic ipants also had to have or establish a \\nBTT wallet address.  \\n111. The Sun Defendants announced this di stribution in a December 22, 2019, post to \\nthe @BitTorrent Medium page: “[t]o celebrate the coming of exciting 2020 year, BitTorrent \\ndecides to give away 7 million BTT to BitTorrent community, in cluding a special big prize for \\nthis Christmas.  Each day during the event, 10 wi nners will be drawn from the selected entries, \\nstarting on December 23th.  Becau se the drawing is done randomly and each user is allowed \\nmultiple entries (see “rules” below), you could wi n multiple days, or even multiple times each \\nday!” \\n112. According to this Medium post, 10 winners chosen daily between December 23, \\n2019, and January 1, 2020, would each received 5 0,000 BTT, with the exception of 10 winners \\non chosen on December 25, 2019, who would receive “a  special big prize for this Christmas” of \\n250,000 BTT each. Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 27 of 50 28113. On December 23, 2019, @BitTorrent also announced the distribution on Twitter, \\nwith a link to the December 22, 2019, Medium post , as well as a link to a website hosted by a \\nthird party that describes itself as “The Business Growth Platform,” where participants could \\nsubmit contest entries. \\n114. According to the entry submission page , 40,484 complete entries were received. \\n115. By completing the steps required to en ter, participants provided the Sun \\nDefendants with valuable consideration, includ ing advertising and publicity for Rainberry and \\nBTT, as well as social media handles for entran ts and the friends they tagged.  In addition, \\nparticipants who had not yet esta blished a BitTorrent account a nd corresponding wallet first had \\nto do so, increasing the apparent number of ac tive BitTorrent users and BTT wallet holders.  \\n116. None of the Sun Defendants took any steps to exclude U.S. persons from \\nreceiving BTT in this offering.  \\nC. Offers and Sales of BTT in the BitTorrent “Discord Giveaway” \\n117. From on or about March 3, 2021, through March 15, 2021, the Sun Defendants \\noffered and sold BTT through a bounty program th ey referred to as a “Discord Giveaway.”  \\n118.

From approximately February 2018 through February 2019, Sun led a team of at \\nleast three Tron Foundation employees and two Rainbe rry employees in a scheme to artificially \\ninflate the trading volume of TRX through wash  trading between acc ounts controlled by the \\nBitTorrent Foundation, Tron and Rainberry employees, and ultimately Sun.   \\n158. Wash trading generally refers to “trades th at occur without a ch ange in beneficial \\nownership.”  SEC v. Williky , 942 F.3d 389, 391 (7th Cir. 2019).  Wash trading is fraudulent Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 34 of 50 35because it creates a “false percep tion of market activity that does  not reflect the true supply and \\ndemand for the securities.”  Id.   \\n159. Sun’s team conducted the wash trading of  TRX on at least the Trading Platform, \\nwhich was based in the United Stat es.  At all relevant times, S un directed and was aware of his \\nteam’s wash trading activities. \\n160. Through this wash trading scheme, Sun and his team created the false and \\nmisleading appearance of legitimate, active TRX trading.  By this scheme, Sun and his team engaged in a series of transactions that created  actual, active trading fo r the purposes of inducing \\nthe purchase or sale of TRX by others and ma king it easier for Sun and the Tron Foundation to \\nsell TRX while keeping its price stable. \\nA. Sun’s Team Opened Nominee Account s on the Trading Platform to \\nManipulate the Market for TRX \\n161. Between about February 23 and Marc h 27, 2018, Sun directed Tron Foundation \\nemployees to open nominee accounts on multiple crypto asset trading platforms, including the Trading Platform.  As described below, S un’s team opened four accounts on the Trading \\nPlatform that were used to wash trade. \\n162. On or about March 27, 2018, Sun’s team opened two accounts on the Trading \\nPlatform in the names of Chinese nationals, one of whom was Sun’s father.  Those accounts \\nwere labeled “Account 16” and “Account 17.”   \\n163. On or about August 26, 2018, Sun’s team opened a third account on the Trading \\nPlatform in the name of a U.S.-based Rainbe rry employee (“U.S. Nominee One”).  That account \\nwas labeled the “Activity Account.” \\n164. On or about September 17, 2018, Sun, U.S. Nominee One, and Rainberry’s Chief \\nFinancial Officer (“CFO”), among others, attende d a “global executive meeting.”  During that Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 35 of 50 36meeting, and as part of the wash trading sche me, Sun approved a wire transfer of $10,000 into \\nU.S. Nominee One’s personal account.  In appr oving the transfer, Sun knew or was reckless in \\nnot knowing that the $10,000 would subsequently be  passed from U.S. Nominee One’s personal \\naccount to the Activity Account and used for wash trading. \\n165. The next day, September 18, 2018, Rainbe rry’s CFO also approved the $10,000 \\nwire transfer and instructed his Rainberry staff to make the transfer to U.S. Nominee One.  \\nRainberry staff complied, making payment from a U. S.-based bank account in Rainberry’s name.   \\n166. On or about September 20, 2018, Sun’s t eam opened a fourth account on the \\nTrading Platform in the name of another U. S.-based Rainberry employee (“U.S. Nominee \\nTwo”).  That account was labe led the “Bancor Account.”  \\n167. The Bancor Account was opened by Sun’s t eam, acting at Sun’s direction, using a \\nscreen-shot photograph of U.S. Nominee Two and certain of U.S. Nominee Two’s personal \\ninformation, without U.S. Nomin ee Two’s knowledge or permission. \\nB. At Sun’s Direction, His Team Engaged in Wash Trading on the Trading \\nPlatform \\n168. Sun controlled the digital wallets and th e TRX tokens used to conduct the wash \\ntrading scheme on the Trading Platform.  S un also directed the team of Tron Foundation \\nemployees who executed the wash trades.  The t eam kept Sun informed of their activities to \\nensure that they were trading consistent with his directives. \\n169. Starting in or about September 2018, Sun received weekly reports detailing his \\nteam’s wash trading activities.  One weekly re port dated September 28, 2018, advised Sun that \\nthe “USD trading pair has started,” referring to  the Activity and Bancor  Accounts that began \\nwash trading on September 26, 2018.  That report al so stated that the grou p’s intended “result in Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 36 of 50 37market-making is to sell TRX” and explained th at the team would “set  up a buying opportunity \\nafter the holidays to balan ce the demand of the currency (s tabilize profits and losses).” \\n170. Another report dated October 30, 2018 stat ed that Sun’s team would adjust its \\nstrategy to respond to the drop in “natural,” i.e., legitimate, TRX trading volume.  That report \\nalso conveyed Sun’s directive that the team in crease TRX trading volume:  “The boss reminded \\nus of the need to increase trade volume, we n eed to increase the liquid parameter next week, \\nconcentrate on binance, bittre x, bithumb, upbit exhanges [sic], increase the daily budget to 2.5 \\nBTC.” \\n171. The wash trading scheme depended, at le ast in part, on a significant supply of \\nTRX.  Sun thus provided his own TRX to his team to facilitate the wash trading scheme. \\n172. From about April 18, 2018 through Februa ry 11, 2019, Sun’s team engaged in \\nwash trades of TRX on the Tr ading Platform using Accounts 16 and 17.  During the 249 days \\nwhen those accounts were active, Sun’s team e ngaged in at least 609,790 wash trades of TRX, \\naveraging about 2,449 wash trades per day. \\n173.

As illustrated in the tables above, the two account pairs—(1) Accounts 16 and 17 \\nand (2) the Activity and Bancor Accounts—enga ged in numerous wash trades of TRX.   \\n177. As reflected in a December 2018 applicati on filed by the BitTorrent Foundation to \\nmake BTT available for trading on a new trad ing platform, the BitTorrent Foundation also \\nowned and controlled Accounts 16 and 17. \\n178. At all relevant times, Sun, acting th rough the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent \\nFoundation, and Rainberry, controlled each of the wash trading accounts, and the trades of TRX \\nin those accounts were executed at Sun’s directio n and with his knowledge.  None of the TRX \\ntrades between those accounts invo lved any change in beneficial ownership or had any legitimate \\neconomic purpose. \\nVI. The Sun Defendants Orchestrated a Cele brity Touting Campaign and Lied \\nto Conceal It \\n179. Beginning in or about January 2021, Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron \\nFoundation, the BitTorrent Founda tion, and Rainberry, began payi ng celebrities, including Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 41 of 50 42Defendants Mahone and Way, among others, to promote TRX and B TT on social media.  Each \\nof the celebrities who touted TRX or BTT had at least one million followers on their social media accounts.  But the celebrities did not disclose the fact that th ey were paid to tout TRX or \\nBTT or the amounts of the payments they received. \\n180. Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron Founda tion, the BitTorrent  Foundation, and \\nRainberry, approved the payments to the celebritie s for their touts of TR X or BTT, respectively, \\nand he funded the payments with his own asse ts.  Sun sent the payments to a Rainberry \\nemployee (the “Rainberry Employee”), who in turn sent funds to an offshore intermediary who was responsible for lining up celebrities to tout  TRX or BTT.  Additionally, Sun instructed the \\nRainberry Employee to ensure that those celebrities did not disclose the fact  that they were paid \\nto tout the tokens.  Sun’s dire ctive was communicated to the cele brities directly or indirectly \\nthrough intermediaries, including the Rainberry Employee.   \\n181. Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at his direction, each acting on behalf of \\nthe Tron Foundation, the BitTorre nt Foundation, and Rainberr y, provided or approved the \\nspecific language that Sun wanted each celebrity to post online to tout TR X and BTT.  Sun then \\namplified the celebrities’ promotional posts on social media by commenting on those posts or \\nretweeting them to Sun’s more than  three million Twitter followers.   \\n182. Sun, acting on behalf of the Tron Founda tion, the BitTorrent  Foundation, and \\nRainberry, thus created the misleading impression th at celebrities were independently interested \\nin investing in TRX and/or BTT.  In fact, the celebrities only touted TRX and/or BTT because \\nthey were paid to do so. \\n183. On or about January 22, 2021, Way tweeted :  “thanks guys, bought some … TRX \\n… 💪 what’s next? let’s go ✔.”  Later, on or about Ja nuary 29, 2021, Way tweeted:  “ ✔$trx = Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 42 of 50 43fast blockchain.”  The Tron Foundation, through e ither Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at \\nhis direction, provided the language for Way’s tw eets, and Sun arranged for Way to be paid \\n$10,000 for those tweets.  But neither  of Way’s tweets disc losed the fact that Way had been paid \\nto tout TRX or the amount of his payment. \\n184. On or about February 11, 2021, an act ress tweeted:  “Exploring #DeFi and \\nalready liking $JST, $SUN on $TRX .  Super fast and 0 fee.  G ood job @ justinsuntron.”  That \\nsame day, another actress tweeted:  “People should use only $TRX cause it’s fast, cheap and hot \\n. . . thanks @justinsuntron.”  The Tron Founda tion, through either Sun or the Rainberry \\nEmployee acting at his direction, provided the language  for each of those tweets.  Also that same \\nday, a singer tweeted:  “What’s an ideal crypto ba g?  Thinking $TRX $BTT $JST $SUN $WIN.”  \\nThe Tron Foundation and BitTorrent Foundation, th rough either Sun or th e Rainberry Employee \\nacting at his direction, provided the language for each of those tw eets.  Sun arranged for these \\nthree celebrities to be pa id $10,000, $955.70, and $12,000, respectively, for their tweets.  None \\nof those tweets, however, disclosed the fact that the celebrities were paid to tout TRX or BTT or \\nthe amounts the payments.   \\n185. The next day, on or about February 12, 2021, Mahone tweeted:  “When $TRX \\nhits 50 cents and $BTT hits 1 cent I’m getting a tattoo of @justinsuntron’s face.”  The Tron \\nFoundation and BitTorrent Foundation, through either  Sun or the Rainberry Employee acting at \\nhis direction, provided the language for Mahone ’s tweet, and Sun arranged for Mahone to be \\npaid Bitcoin valued at $20,059 for the tweet.  Mahone ’s tweet did not disclose the fact that he \\nhad been paid to tout TRX or BTT or the amount of his payment.   \\n186. To conceal the truth about the celebrity touting campaign from the investing \\npublic, Sun falsely denied that he  and the Tron Foundation paid celebr ities to tout.  On or about Case 1:23-cv-02433   Document 1   Filed 03/22/23   Page 43 of 50 44February 16, 2021, Sun tweeted:  “There have been rumors lately of third party celebrities being \\npaid to promote #TRON.  #TR ON Foundation is not i nvolved in these activities.  Nor is the \\nfoundation aware of the actors behind this.”  That same day, about one minute later, Sun \\ntweeted:  “If any celebrities are paid to prom ote TRON, we require them to disclose.”   \\n187. Those tweets by Sun were false.  In fact, as Sun knew, celebrities were paid to \\ntout TRX and BTT; the Tron Foundation and BitT orrent Foundation, through either Sun or the \\nRainberry Employee acting at his direction, provi ded the language for the touts; Sun arranged \\nand funded payments to the celebrities for the tout s; and the celebrities di d not disclose the fact \\nthat they were paid to tout TRX or  BTT or the amounts of their payments.  \\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nViolation of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act \\n(Against Sun, the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry) \\n \\n188.
